# Lockfile Injection

This repository is home to the Lockfile Injection research.

It was originally published in September 2019 as [Why npm lockfiles can be a security blindspot for injecting malicious modules](https://snyk.io/blog/why-npm-lockfiles-can-be-a-security-blindspot-for-injecting-malicious-modules/) on the [Snyk](https://snyk.io) blog.

This open source repository is a continuation of the original research which revealed flaws in popular JavaScript package managers like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).
